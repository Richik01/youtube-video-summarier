you want to study for four hours straight but you can't you want to finish all your work in one sitting but you can't you want to be the topper of the class but how you can't even sit and study for 20 minutes straight without distractions your books are in front of you your teacher is teaching something your friends are talking to you but guess what you are not present over there you're thinking about something else your body is in the class but your mind is in Kenya see if any of these things feel relatable to you boys and girls you're in the right place this is the video that will change everything for you because if you follow everything that I tell you in the next 4 minutes you'll never be distracted again while you're studying and you'll develop something called the laser focus so hello everyone welcome back and if you're new here my name is tarun and I'm a reason graduate from it kakur so after years and years of preparing for multiple exams performing great in some of them but also messing up in a few I clearly understand that there are so many problems which can completely destroy a student's exam preparation like the lack of motivation sleepiness exam fear procrastination and a lot of other things yet the most serious problems that even very highly motivated students face on a daily basis is something called the distractions on an average our human brain gets distracted more than 11 times in an hour while studying and these distractions cost us more than 2 hours every single day think about it like what if you can actually save these hours awesome you'd be having two extra hours every single day when compared to your classmates that's crazy but how do we do that simple here's the solution and we'll have to solve this problem in two different steps the first step is a set of shortterm Solutions and then to make these short-term Solutions more effective we need the long-term Solutions and firstly let's start with the short-term [Music] Solutions I mean imagine you have an exam coming in a couple of days weeks or even couple of months you can use a simple set of five rules to be distraction free while you sit in study so this method is called aladan Sprints which is my personal favorite where you sit for 90 minutes to 12 minutes straight to do a particular task without getting out of your study space you can't even get out of the place for food and water water you should cut down all the external distractions like phone calls or text messages or maybe even lock your phone somewhere else if possible and finally you support your Sprint by putting a timer in front of you and having a Target return on a piece of paper in front of you got it study space timer targets no T switching and finally cut down all the external distractions if you can do around three to four Sprints every single day for the next 3 months no one can stop you from becoming a Topper but then to be very honest it's not so easy for a normal person to do an alran Sprint when they can't even sit and stud for 10 minutes straight without distractions right that's why we start with something around 25 minutes go work Sprint and then slowly increase the time that you can sit and study every single week till you reach 90 minutes think of it like a video game that you're playing slowly increase the level got it but this is rather a short-term solution because it actually doesn't solve the long-term problems like developing insane Focus so how can they naturally sit and study for longer hours without getting distracted to be honest research says that this is actually more connected to a lifestyle sty than the motivation that we actually have so now coming to the long-term solutions that we have these are the five different habits that you should be building in order for your brain to develop insane Focus while doing this ultradian Sprints the first one you are what you eat so don't directly go outside and eat some random street food the second one in the arms of sleeve distractions surrender get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every single day see this is coming from a person who actually did not sleep for 100 hours straight not going to sleep for 100 hours and see what happens to check how our memory actually depends upon our sleep so when I say it I mean it the third one meditation is the key meditate at least for 15 minutes every single day the problem is that everyone tells it but no one follows this the fourth one is a trickier one say no to any kind of relationships during your preparation to an examination because it's not just about managing your time but more about managing your emotions because emotions directly convert into energy and you need to strategically deploy both your time and energy in order to finish a task quickly and sometimes your entire day week or even entire month will get wasted if something goes wrong in the relationship now the final one the fifth one but I guess one of the most important things in this entire list this has been my personal favorite for a long time now say no to high dopamin activities like scrolling reels and watching Pawn I've personally done a 50-day dopamin detox myself and I have to say a lot of things have changed after that I've become more productive I've become much more sharp and I was able to sit and do all the tasks so much quickly I felt like I've actually upgraded to a higher level in the real life and you can do that too but just remember this if you can't control yourself you won't be able to control anything in your life and life would never make a weak human being to the best so decide who got it so with that being said the conclusion if you at this point of time can do three to four ultradian Sprints every single day for the next 3 months along with adapting all these five long-term habits you will become a super human and not even God would be able to distract you while you're sitting there and studying I mean not in little sense but but yeah you you you got the point right finally before I end this video here's a very simple task for you scroll back to the point of the video where I was talking about five habits that you should be building write them on a piece of paper and stick it to the wall in front of your bed because when you see it every day it gets easier for you to build those habits pause the videos right now just just go write it come back and write task completed in the comments below once you finish it so that's all for the video now I'm like back with Full Throttle on the Channel I really want to get to 500k man like so if you're someone who's watching without subscribing like just hit the the the microphone check make it a microphone check give it a microphone I make the make a microphone dead don't step to me newbie I could truly be moody I could have played the Grinch in the movies I've been a part time shadow
